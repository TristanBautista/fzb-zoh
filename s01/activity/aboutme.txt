Tristan Jhon Bautista

My motivation in joining this open house workshop by Zuitt is my passion for the technology field and industry. As a student in a science highschool, I have been exposed to a lot of ICT related knowledge and I yearn to improve my body of knowledge and apply them to solve real world problems we are facing. Moreover, as I am a graduating Senior High school student, I aim to prepare myself for my college course either in BS computer science or another related course. Overall, my passion for tech and my goals for my future career are what motivates me to join this workshop and participate in other activities that hone my skills and knowledge in programming and technology.

Currently, I haven't had any work experience apart from joining innovation and research competitions. As a graduating SHS student, one of our subjectsâ€”Work Immersion, enables us to simulate the work field. I would be having my work immersion along with my classmates hopefully this upcoming march 6 till 19. I would be working in our city's information and communication technology office. To sum it up, throughout highschool and my last year as a senior, I have garnered experience in handling HTML, CSS, and currently Git and I also got to learn some basics of Python. I hope to be able to improve on my skills and garner more valuable experience just like this.
