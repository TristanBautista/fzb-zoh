Tristan Jhon Bautista

My motivation in joining this open house workshop by Zuitt is my passion for the technology field and industry. As a student in a science highschool, I have been exposed to a lot of ICT related knowledge and I yearn to improve my body of knowledge and apply them to solve real world problems we are facing. Moreover, as I am a graduating Senior High school student, I aim to prepare myself for my college course either in BS computer science or another related course. Overall, my passion for tech and my goals for my future career are what motivates me to join this workshop and participate in other activities that hone my skills and knowledge in programming and technology.
